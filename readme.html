<h2>Asset Configuration</h2>
There are two ways to configure an AWS STS asset.  The first is to configure the <b>access_key</b>, <b>secret_key</b> and <b>region</b> variables.  If it is preferred to use a role and Phantom is running as an EC2 instance, the <b>use_role</b> checkbox can be checked instead.  This will allow the role that is attached to the instance to be used.  Please see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html">AWS EC2 and IAM documentation</a> for more information.

<h2>Assuming a Role</h2>
When calling the <b>assume_role</b> action, a dictionary containing the <b>AccessKeyId</b>, <b>SecretAccessKey</b>, <b>SessionToken</b> and <b>Expiration</b> key/value pairs with data path <b>assume_role_1:action_result.data.*.Credentials</b> will be returned.  This dictionary can be passed directly into the <b>credentials</b> parameter in another AWS app's action within a playbook.  These credentials will be used to override the asset configuration of that app when executing the action.  This is true whether the receiving action's asset is configured with the access key and secret key or if the EC2 instance role credentials are used.
